# CleanTube

I made this Chrome extension to hide the parts of YouTube that I don't like.
The elements that this extension hides are:
* The row of recommended videos that appear when a video is paused.
* The wall of recommended videos that appear at the end of a video.
* Channel watermark logos that appear in the bottom right of videos.
* The "Watch later" and "Add to queue" icon buttons that appear over the top
  right of thumbnails when they are hovered over.
